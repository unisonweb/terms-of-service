### How Do We Use the Information We Collect?

#### Personal Information

Your Personal Information may be supplemented with additional information regarding your activities on the Service; to the extent that such information is linked specifically to you, we will treat that additional information as your Personal Information. We may use your email address to contact you to market our materials or for the internal operational and administrative purposes of the Service.

#### User Data

We collect and store User Data in order to provide the Service to you, and it may be used for the internal operational, product development, and administrative purposes of the Service.

#### Web Tracking Information

We use web tracking information to administer the Service and to understand how well our Service is working, to store your user preferences, and to develop statistical information on usage of the Service. This allows us to determine which features and content users like best to help us improve our Service, to personalize your user experience, and to measure overall effectiveness.

#### Aggregate Information

We will also create statistical, aggregated data relating to our users and the Service for analytical purposes. Aggregated data is derived from Personal Information and User Data but in its aggregated form it does not duplicate or reveal any User Data or relate to or identify any individual or entity.

### General

#### Security

We use reasonable security precautions to protect the security and integrity of your Personal Information in accordance with this policy and applicable law. However, no Internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that security breaches will not occur. Without limitation of the foregoing, we are not responsible for the actions of hackers and other unauthorized third parties that breach our reasonable security procedures.

#### Links

During the course of using our Service you may encounter links to other websites or services. Unison is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those websites. Users should be aware of this when they leave our Service and review the privacy statements of each third party website. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Service.

#### Amendments

Unison may modify or amend this policy from time to time. If we make any material changes in the way in which Personal Information is collected, used or transferred, we will notify you of these changes by modification of this Privacy Policy, which will be available for review by you at the Service.

#### Geographic Location

We offer the service in several geographic regions. We define a geographic region as the location where a user is located.

##### Users Within the United States

For users within the United States, we process data in data centers located in the United States. We have adopted reasonable physical, technical, and organizational safeguards against accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, access, use, or processing of user data in our possession. We comply with state and federal laws governing the protection of personal information.

##### Users Within the European Union

For users within the European Union, we transfer data from the European Union to data centers located in the United States for processing.

Transfers of European Union user data to processors in the United States are made in accordance with the GDPR.

For users not within the United States or the European Union, we transfer data from such regions to the United States for processing. For such users, we have adopted reasonable physical, technical, and organizational safeguards against accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, access, use, or processing of user data in our possession that substantially mirror protections available to users located within the United States.

### Retention and Deletion

We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting or reporting requirements.
In some circumstances, we may anonymize your Personal Information so that it can no longer be associated with you, at which point it will no longer be treated as Personal Information.

## 2. CCPA Disclosures

### California Users’ Rights

California residents have certain rights regarding our collection and use of personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“**CCPA**” or the “**Act**”). For purposes of this “CCPA Section,” the term “personal information” means personal information under Cal. Civ. Code 1798.140(o). To the extent that any other provision of this Privacy Policy conflicts a provision of this CCPA Section, the provision in this section controls as to California residents.

California residents may:

- Request that we delete their personal information.
- Opt-out of the sale of their personal information.
- Request information about:
  - (i) the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about the User;
  - (ii) the categories of sources from which we have collected the User’s personal information;
  - (iii) the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the User’s personal information\*;
  - (iv) the categories of personal information we have sold about the User; and
  - (v) the categories of third parties with whom we have shared, disclosed for a business purpose, or sold the User’s personal information, and which categories of personal information we have sold to which categories of third parties.

\*We will not discriminate against Users for exercising their rights under the CCPA.

### Exercising Your Rights

#### Requests for Information

California Users may request that we provide certain information about our use of their personal information, as specified above. Upon receiving a request from a User, we will take reasonable steps to verify the User’s identity. We will respond to a verified User request by: (a) providing the requested information; or (b) explaining to the User why the Act does not require us to provide the requested information.

We will respond to requests for information within 45 days. If a response requires additional time, we will notify the User of the basis for the delay and may extend our response period up to an additional 90 days. If the Act requires us to provide the information requested to the User, we will provide the information covering the 12 months preceding the request, free of charge, and in a readily useable portable format. We have no obligation to provide personal information to a User more than twice in a 12-month period. If a request or series of requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee for processing the request(s), or may refuse to process the request(s).

#### Requests to Opt-Out

California users may opt-out of the sale of their personal information by contacting us at privacy@unison.cloud.

Once we have received a directive from a User to not sell the User’s personal information, we will not sell the User’s personal information unless and until the User subsequently provides express authorization for the sale of the User’s personal information. We will not ask the User for permission to sell their personal information for 12 months after receiving a request to opt-out. We will only use information that a User provides in submitting a request to opt out for purposes of processing the opt-out request.

##### Requests to Delete

California Users may request that we delete their personal information. Upon receiving a request from a User, we will take reasonable steps to verify the User’s identity. We will respond to a verified User request by: (a) deleting the User’s personal information and, if applicable, directing our service providers to delete the User’s personal information; or (ii) explaining to the User why the Act does not require us to delete their personal information.

If a request or series of requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee for processing the request(s), or may refuse to process the request(s).

##### Minors

If we have actual knowledge that a User is under 16 years of age, we will not sell the User’s personal information unless the User – or, in the case of Users who are less than 13 years of age, the User’s parent or guardian – affirmatively “opts in” to the sale of the User’s information.
